              <br />
              <p>As a full-stack JavaScript developer, I have been studying since February 2022 through FreeCodeCamp. I successfully completed courses in frontend development using React and Bootstrap, responsive web design with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as JavaScript intermediate algorithms.</p>
              <br />
              <p>I also accomplished the backend development and APIs course, gaining knowledge of npm, Node.js, Express, and databases like MongoDB and Mongoose. Over the past six months, I have primarily focused on creating beginner and mid-level applications using React, further enhancing my skills and experience.</p>
